<p>Sony to sell PC  unit and cut jobs</p>
<p>Sony is to sell its personal  computer (PC) unit and cut 5,000 jobs as part of a plan to reverse heavy  losses.</p>
<p>The  company will also split its TV division into a separate subsidiary as part of  its restructuring programme.The moves were  announced&nbsp;as Sony  forecast a net loss of 110bn yen ($1.08bn; Â£665m) for the financial year to 31  March, revising its earlier projection of a 30bn yen profit. The TV and PC  units have been a big drag on its earnings in recent years. Last month, ratings  agency Moody's cited concerns over the two divisions as a key reason behind its&nbsp;move to cut the  Japanese firm's credit rating&nbsp;to  junk status.Moody's said at the time that it expected earnings from Sony's  core businesses to continue to face &quot;significant&quot; downward pressure. The  annual loss forecast came despite&nbsp;Sony reporting a  net profit&nbsp;of 27bn yen for the October-to-December quarter,  up from a net loss of 10.8bn yen during the same period a year ago.Restructuring  divisions </p>
<p>Sony's TV division has been hurt by increased competition and  slowing global demand. A decline in TV prices has further hurt the  profitability of the unit. The firm has taken some steps to try to turn around  the TV division, including cutting costs and shifting its focus to developing  high-end TV models.Sony said the moves had helped it to narrow losses in the  division to 69.6bn yen in the last financial year, down from 147.5bn yen a year  ago. It added that it expected the losses to be reduced further to 25bn yen in  the current financial year. Sony Corp's CEO, Kazuo Hirai, said there were no  plans for the company's TV business to share the same fate as its PC division.&quot;We are beginning to see the path to a turnaround in our TV  business,&quot; he said. &quot;TV remains an important category for Sony.&quot;  However, it said its previous target of returning both the TV and PC businesses  to profitability would not be achieved within the current financial year.Sony said that splitting the unit into a wholly-owned subsidiary  would help it &quot;further enhance&quot; the unit's profit structure and  return the business to profitability. Meanwhile, a continued decline in global  PC sales - which have fallen for six quarters in a row - have hurt its PC unit.</p>
<p>Smartphone  focusSony said it had decided to sell the division and concentrate on  making smartphones and tablets - two sectors that are seeing robust growth.</p>
<p>Sony has already benefitted from the growth in these sectors,  saying that &quot;a significant increase in smartphones&quot; had boosted its  earnings in the last three months of 2013.</p>
<p>It aims to finalise an agreement to sell its PC business, which  operates under the Vaio brand, to Japan Industrial Partners by the end of next  month.</p>
<p>Of the 5,000 job cuts announced, about 1,500 will come from  Japan, and the rest from Sony's oversees operations.</p>
<p>Those cuts come on top the 10,000 job losses Sony has announced  over the previous year.</p>
